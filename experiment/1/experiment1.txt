Write a program in LC-3 machine language that counts the number of "ones"
in location x3050 and stores the result in location x3051.  Your program
should start with the first instruction in x3000.  Your program should
terminate with the Halt instruction, which is a trap to the operating 
system. The instruction is: 1111000000100101.  The TRAP instruction will
be explained on Monday in class.
